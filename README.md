# AQI-Prediction-and-Analysis
Air Quality Index Analysis with EDA, Forecasting, Clustering, and Seasonal Insights
This project implements a complete machine-learning workflow that spans data preprocessing, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and automated seasonal interpretation. The primary focus is on identifying pollution trends, forecasting air-quality behaviour, grouping pollution levels, and generating meaningful insights from temporal patterns.
